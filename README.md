# Snake Game
My customized version of Scrimba's snake game, using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

## My added features
- Changed the size of the grid to 200px x 200px
- Added my own colors, font and background
- Added buttons to make it possible to play the game on a mobile phone or tablet
- Added a game over - message that pops up after the snake has it a wall or eaten itself
- Created to options for the snake's food to be created, randomly either an apple (single amount of points, speed of the snake increases) or a pear (double amount of points, speed of the snake increases faster)
- Changed the design of the snake and added images for the apple and the pear
- Used e.preventDefault() to stop the browser window from moving up and down when the arrow keys are clicked

## To Do
- Create a "break" button, to pause the game, but not reset it at the same time

## Updates
- Added a media query to create a responsive layout

## Deployment
